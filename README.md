# Application Requirements

The requirements text file has been added to the repository.

This is a file that is going to help keep record and manage package dependencies for the project.
To make use of this file you will need to navigate to the folder that contains the file "requirements.txt" with regard to this project, using the terminal.

If you are on windows, you shall make use of the Windows Command Prompt or Windows Powershell. If you are on mac then the terminal would do just fine.

You will then need to run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
in your respective shell.
